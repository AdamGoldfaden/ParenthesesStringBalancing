# ParenthesesStringBalancing
This program takes a string of left and right parentheses characters and balances it by adding the appopriate number of characters to each end of the string. To determine the correct amount of paretheses to add, the program first iterates through the input string from left to right, pushing onto a stack when finding a left parenthesis and popping when it finds a right parenthesis. This way, we keep track of how many unbalanced left parenthesis characters there are.  Then, we do the same process but from right to left for the right parenthesis character. When both iterations are complete, we add on a number of right parenthesis equal to the size of the left parenthesis stack (to create a balance). The same is then done for the left parenthesis character.  At the completion of the program, it will print the the correctly balanced parentheses string!
